This is the "zetuptoolz" fork of setuptools. This version is forked from
setuptools trunk r80621 (which is current as of 2010-08-31), with the following
differences:


 * Zooko's patches for the following bugs and features have been applied:
 
     <http://bugs.python.org/setuptools/issue17>
     "easy_install will install a package that is already there"

     <http://bugs.python.org/setuptools/issue54>
     "be more like distutils with regard to --prefix="

     <http://bugs.python.org/setuptools/issue53>
     "respect the PYTHONPATH"


 * The following patch to setuptools introduced bugs, and has been reverted
   in zetuptoolz:

    $ svn log -r 45514

    Backport pkgutil, pydoc, and doctest from the 2.5 trunk to setuptools
    0.7 trunk.  (Sideport?)  Setuptools 0.7 will install these in place of
    the 2.3/2.4 versions (at least of pydoc and doctest) to let them work
    properly with eggs.  pkg_resources now depends on the 2.5 pkgutil, which
    is included here as _pkgutil, to work around the fact that some system
    packagers will install setuptools without overriding the stdlib modules.
    But users who install their own setuptools will get them, and the system
    packaged people probably don't need them.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------


 * The scripts written by zetuptoolz have the following extra line:

     # generated by zetuptoolz <version number>

   after the header.


 * Windows-specific changes (native Python):

   Python distributions may have command-line or GUI scripts.
   On Windows, setuptools creates an executable wrapper to run each
   script. zetuptools uses a different approach that does not require
   an .exe wrapper. It writes approximately the same script file that
   is used on other platforms, but with a .pyscript extension.
   It also writes a shell-script wrapper (without any extension) that
   is only used when the command is run from a Cygwin shell.

   Some of the advantages of this approach are:

    * Unicode arguments are preserved (although the program will
      need to use some Windows-specific code to get at them in
      current versions of Python);
    * it works correctly on 64-bit Windows;
    * the zetuptoolz distribution need not contain either any
      binary executables, or any C code that needs to be compiled.

   See setuptools\tests\win_script_wrapper.txt for further details.

   Installing or building any distribution on Windows will automatically
   associate .pyscript with the native Python interpreter for the current
   user. It will also add .pyscript and .pyw to the PATHEXT variable for
   the current user, which is needed to allow scripts to be run without
   typing any extension.

   There is an additional setup.py command that can be used to perform
   these steps separately (which isn't normally needed, but might be
   useful for debugging):

     python setup.py scriptsetup

   Adding the --allusers option, i.e.

     python setup.py scriptsetup --allusers

   will make the .pyscript association and changes to the PATHEXT variable
   for all users of this Windows installation, except those that have it
   overridden in their per-user environment. In this case setup.py must be
   run with Administrator privileges, e.g. from a Command Prompt whose
   shortcut has been set to run as Administrator.
