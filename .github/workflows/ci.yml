          #
          # Since the build is done I'm going to guess that "done" is a fine
          # value for status.
          #
          # That leaves "build_num".  The coveralls documentation gives some
          # hints about it.  It suggests using $CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID if your job
          # is on CircleCI.  CircleCI documentation says this about
          # CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID:
          #
          #    A unique identifier for the workflow instance of the current
          #    job. This identifier is the same for every job in a given
          #    workflow instance.
          #
          # (from https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/)
          #
          # A CircleCI workflow is roughly "the group of jobs run for a
          # particular commit".  There are exceptions to this but maybe we can
          # ignore them.
          #
          # The only over hints we get from Coveralls about "build_num" are:
          #
          # * An example value of `1234`
          #
          # * Another example value of `$BUILD_NUMBER` where BUILD_NUMBER is
          #   not defined anywhere.
          #
          # Starting from the CircleCI workflow example, then, and looking at
          # the environment variables GitHub Actions offers
          # (https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/environment-variables#default-environment-variables) there are two of interest:
          #
          # * GITHUB_RUN_ID - A unique number for each run within a
          #   repository. This number does not change if you re-run the
          #   workflow run.
          #
          # * GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER - A unique number for each run of a particular
          #   workflow in a repository. This number begins at 1 for the
          #   workflow's first run, and increments with each new run. This
          #   number does not change if you re-run the workflow run.
          #
          # These seem to offer approximately the same value and only differ
          # on whether they will be unique for the project as a whole or just
          # for this particular workflow ("ci", as defined by this file).
          #
          # Unfortunately neither of them changes if a workflow is re-run.
          # This differs from the behavior of CircleCI's CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID
          # where a new value is assigned if a workflow is re-run.
          #
          # The consequence of this would seem to be that multiple runs of a
          # GitHub Actions workflow will have their coverage reported to the
          # same job.  And since we eventually "finish" a job, later runs
          # would be discarded (I suppose).
          #
          # There doesn't seem to be a way to do any better, though.
          #
          # However, we have the further constraint that our build_num must
          # agree with whatever coveralls-python has selected.  An inspection
          # of the coveralls-python source suggests that GITHUB_RUN_ID is
          # used.  However, observation of the coveralls.io web interface
          # suggests the value instead is something more like:
          #
          #    $(git rev-parse refs/pull/<PR NUM>/merge)-PR-<PR NUM>
          #
          # Thus, we select the same.

          # refs/pull/<PR NUM>/merge was justed checked out by so we can just
          # rev-parse HEAD to find the revision.
          REV=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
