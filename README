Welcome to the AllMyData "tahoe" project. This project implements a
scalable distributed fault-tolerant filestore.

The basic idea is that the data in this filesystem is spread over all
participating nodes, using an algorithm that can recover the data even if a
majority of the nodes are no longer available.

The main application code is in the 'allmydata' package, under src/allmydata/
. There is also a patched version of PyCrypto (adding a faster CTR-mode) in
src/Crypto/ which gets installed to the 'allmydata.Crypto' package (since the
API is different than the normal Crypto package). It also includes Zooko's
PyFEC library, a fast python wrapper around the Rizzo 'fec' C library,
installed to the 'pyfec' package and located in src/pyfec/ .

DEPENDENCIES:

 Python 2.4 or newer (tested against both 2.4 and 2.5)
  http://python.org/
 Twisted (probably 2.4.0 or newer)
  http://twistedmatrix.com/
  The default subpackages should all be included by default, but in
    case they aren't they are the following:
   * core (the standard Twisted package)
   * web, trial, conch
  Note that Twisted requires zope.interface, and that the standard
  batteries-included Twisted distribution includes a copy.
 Foolscap (0.1.2 or newer)
  - note: since the Foolscap wire protocol is not yet compatible from one
    release to the next, make sure all of your nodes are using the same
    version of Foolscap
  http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/FoolsCap
 Nevow (probably 0.9.0 or later)
  http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodNevow
 PyOpenSSL (0.6 or later)
  http://pyopenssl.sourceforge.net

 a C compiler (if building on Windows, cygwin gcc with mingw32 support)
  http://gcc.gnu.org/
  http://www.cygwin.com/
 GNU make

BUILDING:

 Just type 'make'. This works on Windows too, provided that you have the 
 dependencies mentioned above.  If the desired version of 'python' is not 
 already on your PATH, then type 'make PYTHON=/path/to/your/preferred/python'.

 'make test' runs the unit test suite.

INSTALLING:

 If you're running on a debian system, use 'make deb-dapper' or 'make
 deb-sid' to construct a debian package named 'allmydata-tahoe', which you
 can then install.

 If not, you'll need to run three separate install steps, one for each of the
 three subpackages (allmydata, allmydata.Crypto, and pyfec). You may wish to
 use a different version of 'python' for these steps, or provide a --prefix
 or --root argument for the install.

  cd src/pyfec && python setup.py install && cd ../..

  cd src/Crypto && python setup.py install && cd ../..

  # the allmydata subpackage's setup.py script is in the root directory
  python setup.py install

 To test that all the modules got installed properly, start a python
 interpreter and import modules as follows:

  % python
  Python 2.4.4 (#2, Jan 13 2007, 17:50:26)
  [GCC 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (Debian 4.1.1-21)] on linux2
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  >>> import allmydata.Crypto
  >>> import allmydata.interfaces
  >>> import fec
  >>>

 To run from a source tree (without installing first), type 'make', which
 will put all the necessary libraries into a local directory named
 instdir/lib/pythonN.N/site-packages/ , which you can then add to your
 PYTHONPATH .


RUNNING:

 If you installed one of the debian packages constructed by "make deb-*" then
 it creates an 'allmydata-tahoe' executable, usually in /usr/bin . If you
 didn't install a package you can find allmydata-tahoe in instdir/scripts.
 This tool is used to create, start, and stop nodes. Each node lives in a
 separate base directory, inside of which you can add files to configure and
 control the node. Nodes also read and write files within that directory.

 A mesh consists of a single central 'queen' node and a large number of
 'client' nodes. If you are joining an existing mesh, the queen node will
 already be running, and you'll just need to create a client node. If you're
 creating a brand new mesh, you'll need to create both a queen and a client
 (and then invite other people to create their own client nodes and join your
 mesh).

 The queen node is constructed by running 'allmydata-tahoe create-queen
 --basedir WHERE'. Once constructed, you can start the queen by running
 'allmydata-tahoe start --basedir WHERE'. Inside that base directory, there
 will be a pair of files 'introducer.furl' and 'vdrive.furl'. Make a copy of
 these, as they'll be needed on the client nodes.

 To construct a client node, pick a new working directory for it, then run
 'allmydata-tahoe create-client --basedir $HERE'. Copy the two .furl files
 from the queen into this new directory, then run 'allmydata-tahoe start
 --basedir $HERE'. After that, the client node should be off and running. The
 first thing it will do is connect to the queen and introduce itself to all
 other nodes on the mesh. You can follow its progress by looking at the
 $HERE/twistd.log file.

 To actually use the client, enable the web interface by writing a port
 number (like "8080") into a file named $HERE/webport and then restarting the
 node with 'allmydata-tahoe restart --basedir $HERE'. This will prompt the
 client node to run a webserver on the desired port, through which you can
 view, upload, download, and delete files.
