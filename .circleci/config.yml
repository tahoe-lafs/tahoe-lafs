# https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/

# We use version 2.1 of CircleCI's configuration format (the docs are still at
# the 2.0 link) in order to have access to Windows executors. This means we
# can't use dots in job names anymore. They have a new "parameters" feature
# that is supposed to remove the need to have version numbers in job names (the
# source of our dots), but switching to that is going to be a bigger refactor:
