Proposed Specifications
=======================

This directory is where we hold design notes about upcoming/proposed
features. Usually this is kept in tickets on the `bug tracker`_, but
sometimes we put this directly into the source tree.

.. _bug tracker: https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac

Most of these files are plain text, should be read from a source tree. This
index only lists the files that are in .rst format.
