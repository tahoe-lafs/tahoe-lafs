    <h1>About Tahoe-LAFS</h1>
    <p>Welcome to <a href="http://tahoe-lafs.org">the Tahoe-LAFS project</a>, a secure, decentralized, fault-tolerant filesystem. <a href="about.html">About Tahoe-LAFS.</a>

    <h1>How To Get Tahoe-LAFS</h1>

    <p>This procedure has been verified to work on Windows, Mac, many flavors of Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD.  It's likely to work on other platforms.  If you have trouble getting Tahoe-LAFS running this way, please write to <a href="http://tahoe-lafs.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tahoe-dev">the tahoe-dev mailing list</a>, where friendly hackers will help you out.</p>

    <h2>Install Python</h2>

    <p>Check if you already have an adequate version of Python installed by running <cite>python -V</cite>.  Python&nbsp;v2.4 (v2.4.4 or greater), Python&nbsp;v2.5 or Python&nbsp;v2.6 will work. Python&nbsp;v3 does not work. On Windows, we recommend the use of Python&nbsp;v2.6 (native, not Cygwin). If you don't have one of these versions of Python installed, then follow the instructions on <a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.5/">the Python download page</a> to download and install Python&nbsp;v2.6. Make sure that the path to the installation directory has no spaces in it (e.g. on Windows, do not install Python in the "<tt>Program Files</tt>" directory).</p>
    <p>If you are on Windows, you now must manually install the pywin32 package from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/">the pywin32 site</a> before getting Tahoe-LAFS. Make sure to get the correct file for the version of Python you are using &mdash; e.g. ending in "py2.6.exe" for Python&nbsp;v2.6. If using 64-bit Windows, the file should have "win-amd64" in its name.</p>

    <h2>Get Tahoe-LAFS</h2>

      <p>Download the 1.7.1 zip file:</p>
      <pre><a
      href="http://tahoe-lafs.org/source/tahoe-lafs/releases/allmydata-tahoe-1.7.1.zip">http://tahoe-lafs.org/source/tahoe-lafs/releases/allmydata-tahoe-1.7.1.zip</a></pre>

    <h2>Set Up Tahoe-LAFS</h2>

    <p>Unpack the zip file and cd into the top-level directory.</p>

    <p>Run <cite>python setup.py build</cite> to generate the <cite>tahoe</cite> executable in a subdirectory of the current directory named <cite>bin</cite>.</p>

    <p>On Windows, the <cite>build</cite> step might tell you to open a new Command Prompt (or, on XP and earlier, to log out and back in again). This is needed the first time you set up Tahoe-LAFS on a particular installation of Windows.</p>

    <p>Optionally run <cite>python setup.py test</cite> to verify that it passes all of its self-tests.</p>

    <p>Run <cite>bin/tahoe --version</cite> (on Windows, <cite>bin\tahoe --version</cite>) to verify that the executable tool prints out the right version number.</p>

    <h2>Run Tahoe-LAFS</h2>

    <p>Now you are ready to deploy a decentralized filesystem.  The <cite>tahoe</cite> executable in the <cite>bin</cite> directory can configure and launch your Tahoe-LAFS nodes.  See <a href="running.html">running.html</a> for instructions on how to do that.</p>


    <h2>Advanced Installation</h2>

    <p>For optional features such as tighter integration with your operating system's package manager, you can see the <a href="http://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe/wiki/AdvancedInstall">AdvancedInstall</a> wiki page. The options on that page are not necessary to use Tahoe-LAFS and can be complicated, so we do not recommend following that page unless you have unusual requirements for advanced optional features. For most people, you should first follow the instructions on this page, and if that doesn't work then ask for help by writing to <a href="http://tahoe-lafs.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tahoe-dev">the tahoe-dev mailing list</a>.</p>
