# Tahoe-LAFS actually does work at least as well as any package works when
# zipped, but zipping eggs causes various problems
# (http://bugs.python.org/setuptools/issue33 ), and generally makes it harder
# for people to get at the source code, and doesn't actually provide any
# benefits that I am aware of.
zip_ok=False

# Tahoe-LAFS depends upon several libraries (foolscap, twisted, pycryptopp,
# zfec, and others). Left to its own devices, setuptools will look on PyPI for
# these and will download them at build time. The 'find_links=' entry in
# setup.cfg causes setuptools to look for these dependent tarballs in
# tahoe-deps/ and ../tahoe-deps/ before it resorts to downloading them from
# PyPI.

# http://tahoe-lafs.org/source/tahoe-lafs/deps/tahoe-deps.tar.gz contains a
# bundle of these dependencies (as Python source distributions or "sdists"). So
# it you want to avoid the build-time download (say, if you're on an airplane,
# or a desert island), just grab a copy and unpack it in your tahoe darcs tree.

# Alternatively, if you're building from a release/nightly tarball instead of
# a darcs tree, the 'sumo' tarball variant will include all of these
# dependencies in the tahoe-deps/ directory.
