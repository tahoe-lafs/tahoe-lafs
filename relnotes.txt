ANNOUNCING: Allmydata-Tahoe version 0.8

We are pleased to announce the release of version 0.8 of allmydata.org
"Tahoe".

Allmydata.org "Tahoe" is a secure, decentralized, fault-tolerant
filesystem.  All of the source code is available under a Free
Software, Open Source licence (or two).

This filesystem is encrypted and distributed over multiple peers in
such a way that it continues to work correctlly even when some of the
peers are unavailable, malfunctioning, or malicious.

This is the successor to Allmydata-Tahoe v0.7, which was released
January 8, 2008 [1].

This release improves performance, diagnostics, and packaging.  This
release of allmydata.org "Tahoe" will form the basis of the next
consumer backup product from Allmydata, Inc. -- http://allmydata.com .


Since v0.7 we've made the following changes:

 * Add an upload/download helper, with resumption and short-circuiting
   of upload if the file is already uploaded (tickets #116, #258,
   #218).

 * Add a preliminary Microsoft Windows package (ticket #195).

 * Add a preliminary Macintosh package (ticket #182).

 * Display information about peers (ticket #32).

 * Display information about uploads and downloads (ticket #39).

 * Add unit tests and docs for contrib/fuse.

 * Update docs, starting with docs/about.html --
   http://allmydata.org/source/tahoe/trunk/docs/about.html .

 * Improve logging, diagnostic tools, statistics, timing of upload
   performance, etc..

 * Make upload continue even if some servers disappear during the
   upload process.

 * Make introduction more efficient by allowing nodes to act as
   clients-only and not publish themselves as servers (ticket #271).

 * Extend the web API to allow programmatic control of mutable files.

 * Fix potential problem that could cause corruption of downloaded
   mutable files if a long series of unlikely coincidences and hacked
   clients occurred (ticket #312).


WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR?

With Tahoe, you can distribute your filesystem across a set of
computers, such that if some of the computers fail or turn out to be
malicious, the filesystem continues to work from the remaining
computers.  You can also share your files with other users, using a
strongly encrypted, capability-based access control scheme.

This release is targeted at hackers and smart users who are willing to
use a web user interface, a command-line user interface, or a FUSE
interface.  (Or a RESTful API.  Just telnet to localhost and type HTTP
requests to get started.)

Because this software is new, it is not yet recommended for storage of
highly confidential data nor for valuable data which is not otherwise
backed up. However, it works well in practice, it comes with extensive
unit tests, and there are no known security flaws which would
compromise confidentiality or data integrity.  (For a current
description of all known security issues and an overview of Tahoe's
security properties, please see the Security web page: [2].)

This release of Tahoe is suitable for the "friendnet" use case [3] --
it is easy to create a filesystem spread over the computers of you
and your friends so that you can share files and disk space with one
another.
