ANNOUNCING Tahoe, the Least-Authority File System, v1.9.1

The Tahoe-LAFS team has announced the immediate availability of
version 1.9.1 of Tahoe-LAFS, an extremely reliable distributed
storage system. Get it here:

https://tahoe-lafs.org/source/tahoe-lafs/trunk/docs/quickstart.rst

Tahoe-LAFS is the first distributed storage system to offer
"provider-independent security" — meaning that not even the
operators of your storage servers can read or alter your data
without your consent. Here is the one-page explanation of its
unique security and fault-tolerance properties:

https://tahoe-lafs.org/source/tahoe-lafs/trunk/docs/about.rst

The previous stable release of Tahoe-LAFS was v1.9.0, released
on October 31, 2011.

v1.9.1 is a critical bugfix release which fixes a significant
security issue [#1654]. See the NEWS file [1] and known_issues.rst
[2] file for details.


WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR?

With Tahoe-LAFS, you distribute your filesystem across
multiple servers, and even if some of the servers fail or are
taken over by an attacker, the entire filesystem continues to
work correctly, and continues to preserve your privacy and
security. You can easily share specific files and directories
with other people.

In addition to the core storage system itself, volunteers
have built other projects on top of Tahoe-LAFS and have
integrated Tahoe-LAFS with existing systems, including
Windows, JavaScript, iPhone, Android, Hadoop, Flume, Django,
Puppet, bzr, mercurial, perforce, duplicity, TiddlyWiki, and
more. See the Related Projects page on the wiki [3].

We believe that strong cryptography, Free and Open Source
Software, erasure coding, and principled engineering practices
make Tahoe-LAFS safer than RAID, removable drive, tape,
on-line backup or cloud storage.

This software is developed under test-driven development, and
there are no known bugs or security flaws which would
compromise confidentiality or data integrity under recommended
use. (For all important issues that we are currently aware of
please see the known_issues.rst file [2].)


COMPATIBILITY

This release is compatible with the version 1 series of
Tahoe-LAFS. Clients from this release can write files and
directories in the format used by clients of all versions back
to v1.0 (which was released March 25, 2008). Clients from this
release can read files and directories produced by clients of
all versions since v1.0. Servers from this release can serve
clients of all versions back to v1.0 and clients from this
release can use servers of all versions back to v1.0.

This is the sixteenth release in the version 1 series. This
series of Tahoe-LAFS will be actively supported and maintained
for the foreseeable future, and future versions of Tahoe-LAFS
will retain the ability to read and write files compatible
with this series.
