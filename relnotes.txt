ANNOUNCING Tahoe, the Least-Authority File Store, v1.19.0

The Tahoe-LAFS team is pleased to announce version 1.19.0 of
Tahoe-LAFS, an extremely reliable decentralized storage
system. Get it with "pip install tahoe-lafs", or download a
tarball here:

  https://tahoe-lafs.org/downloads

Tahoe-LAFS is the first distributed storage system to offer
"provider-independent security" — meaning that not even the
operators of your storage servers can read or alter your data
without your consent. Here is the one-page explanation of its
unique security and fault-tolerance properties:

  https://tahoe-lafs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/about.html

The previous stable release of Tahoe-LAFS was v1.18.0, released on
October 2, 2022. Major new features and changes in this release:

A new "Grid Manager" feature allows clients to specify any number of
parties whom they will use to limit which storage-server that client
talks to. See docs/managed-grid.rst for more.

The new HTTP-based "Great Black Swamp" protocol is now enabled
(replacing Foolscap). This allows integrators to start with their
favourite HTTP library (instead of implementing Foolscap first). Both
storage-servers and clients support this new protocol.

`tahoe run` will now exit if its stdin is closed (but accepts --allow-stdin-close now).

Mutables may be created with a pre-determined signature key; care must
be taken!

This release drops Python 3.7 support and adds Python 3.11 and 3.12
support. Several performance improvements have been made. Introducer
correctly listens on Tor or I2P. Debian 10 and Ubuntu 20.04 are no
longer tested.

Besides all this there have been dozens of other bug-fixes and
improvements.

Enjoy!

Please see ``NEWS.rst`` [1] for a complete list of changes.


WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR?

With Tahoe-LAFS, you distribute your data across multiple
servers. Even if some of the servers fail or are taken over
by an attacker, the entire file store continues to function
correctly, preserving your privacy and security. You can
easily share specific files and directories with other people.

In addition to the core storage system itself, volunteers
have built other projects on top of Tahoe-LAFS and have
integrated Tahoe-LAFS with existing systems, including
Windows, JavaScript, iPhone, Android, Hadoop, Flume, Django,
Puppet, bzr, mercurial, perforce, duplicity, TiddlyWiki, and
more. See the Related Projects page on the wiki [3].

We believe that strong cryptography, Free and Open Source
Software, erasure coding, and principled engineering practices
make Tahoe-LAFS safer than RAID, removable drive, tape,
on-line backup or cloud storage.

This software is developed under test-driven development, and
there are no known bugs or security flaws which would
compromise confidentiality or data integrity under recommended
use. (For all important issues that we are currently aware of
please see the known_issues.rst file [2].)


COMPATIBILITY

This release should be compatible with the version 1 series of
Tahoe-LAFS. Clients from this release can write files and
directories in the format used by clients of all versions back
to v1.0 (which was released March 25, 2008). Clients from this
release can read files and directories produced by clients of
all versions since v1.0.

Network connections are limited by the Introducer protocol in use. If
the Introducer is running v1.10 or v1.11, then servers from this
release can serve clients of all versions back to v1.0 . If it is
running v1.12 or higher, then they can only serve clients back to
v1.10. Clients from this release can use servers back to v1.10, but
not older servers.

Except for the new optional MDMF format, we have not made any
intentional compatibility changes. However we do not yet have
the test infrastructure to continuously verify that all new
versions are interoperable with previous versions. We intend
to build such an infrastructure in the future.

This is the twenty-second release in the version 1 series. This
series of Tahoe-LAFS will be actively supported and maintained
for the foreseeable future, and future versions of Tahoe-LAFS
will retain the ability to read and write files compatible
with this series.

HACKING AND COMMUNITY

Please join us on the mailing list [7]. Patches are gratefully
accepted -- the Roadmap page [8] shows the next improvements
that we plan to make and CREDITS [9] lists the names of people
who've contributed to the project. The Dev page [10] contains
resources for hackers.


SPONSORSHIP

A special thanks goes out to Least Authority Enterprises [12],
which employs several Tahoe-LAFS developers, for their
continued support.

HACK TAHOE-LAFS!

If you can find a security flaw in Tahoe-LAFS which is serious
enough that we feel compelled to warn our users and issue a fix,
then we will award you with a customized t-shirt with your
exploit printed on it and add you to the "Hack Tahoe-LAFS Hall
Of Fame" [13].


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This is the twentieth release of Tahoe-LAFS to be created solely as a
labor of love by volunteers. Thank you very much to the team of
"hackers in the public interest" who make Tahoe-LAFS possible.
